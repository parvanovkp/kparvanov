I am a recent graduate from the University of Colorado Boulder with a Master of Science in Applied Mathematics, specializing in Data Science and Machine Learning. I am actively seeking roles in Data Science, Data Analytics, or Software Engineering. My background includes strong skills in mathematical modeling, statistical analysis, and machine learning, paired with hands-on experience in developing predictive models and implementing advanced algorithms.


#### Research Interests
I have explored high-dimensional probability, numerical analysis, machine learning, and neural networks. My recent research involved establishing a probability-based bound for the spectral norm of expansive matrices, bridging theoretical mathematics with practical data science applications.

I am eager to bring my analytical skills and research experience to impactful projects in a dynamic work environment.
