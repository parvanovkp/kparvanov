I hold a Master of Science in Applied Mathematics from the University of Colorado Boulder, with a focus on Data Science and Machine Learning. I am pursuing roles in Data Science, Data Analytics, or Software Engineering, where I can apply my expertise in mathematical modeling, statistical analysis, and machine learning. I have practical experience developing predictive models and implementing complex algorithms.


<!-- #### Research Interests
My research has spanned high-dimensional probability, numerical analysis, machine learning, and neural networks. Most recently, I developed a probability-based bound for the spectral norm of expansive matrices, connecting abstract mathematics with real-world data science problems.

I am excited to apply my analytical skills to meaningful projects in a fast-paced, collaborative environment.
