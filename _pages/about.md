I am a third year PhD student in the Applied Mathematics Department at the University of Colorado at Boulder. My advisor is [Prof. Stephen Becker](https://stephenbeckr.github.io/). I graduated *Summa Cum Laude* from Lake Forest College in May 2020, earning a double BA in Mathematics and Economics. 


##### Research Interests
I am interested in a wide range of topics, including `high-dimensional probability` and `numerical analysis` to `machine learning` and `neural networks`. My current research project revolves around establishing a one-pass probability-based bound for the spectral norm of expansive matrices.
