I'm a third-year MS student in Applied Mathematics at the University of Colorado Boulder, currently under the guidance of [Prof. Stephen Becker](https://stephenbeckr.github.io/). I graduated *Summa Cum Laude* from Lake Forest College in May 2020, with a BA in Mathematics and Economics. As I approach my graduation in May 2024, I am actively seeking for job opportunities in machine learning and data science, where I can apply my strong foundation in mathematical modeling, statistical analysis, and my passion for innovative problem-solving.

#### Research Interests
My academic pursuits have led me to explore a wide range of topics, from high-dimensional probability and numerical analysis to machine learning and neural networks. My current research project involves establishing a one-pass, probability-based bound for the spectral norm of expansive matrices, reflecting my interest in bridging theoretical mathematics with practical applications in data science.

I am eager to bring my analytical skills and research experience into a dynamic work environment, contributing to impactful projects in machine learning and data science.
