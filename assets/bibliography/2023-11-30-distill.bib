Moreover, the approach offers several inherent performance benefits not available before. The FPS uses geometry and gravity to achieve the desired seismic isolation results. It is based on well known engineering principles of pendulum motion, and is constructed of materials with demonstrated longevity and resistance to environmental deterioration. The desirable isolation characteristics exhibited by FPS components hold the promise of an effective and practical system for significantly increasing the seismic resistance of new and existing buildings. This paper summarizes results of a comprehensive research and testing program to assess the technical performance of the FPS. In addition, an example building design using the FPS is given.}",

abstract = {This paper considers the nonlinear interaction of the rigid body dynamics of a spacecraft with the sloshing dynamics of the liquid propellant in its partially filled spherical tank during an orbital transfer. Fuel slosh dynamics are described by a three-dimensional two-pendulum model characterizing the first two sloshing modes, and the coupled equations of motion of the vehicle and the fuel masses are derived by means of quasi-Lagrangian equations. In addition, this paper studies active nonlinear control methods to control the attitude of the spacecraft while suppressing the sloshing of fuel. Simulations are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of these control methods.}

abstract = {We show that standard multilayer feedforward networks with as few as a single hidden layer and arbitrary bounded and nonconstant activation function are universal approximators with respect to Lp(μ) performance criteria, for arbitrary finite input environment measures μ, provided only that sufficiently many hidden units are available. If the activation function is continuous, bounded and nonconstant, then continuous mappings can be learned uniformly over compact input sets. We also give very general conditions ensuring that networks with sufficiently smooth activation functions are capable of arbitrarily accurate approximation to a function and its derivatives.}

abstract = {We introduce physics-informed neural networks – neural networks that are trained to solve supervised learning tasks while respecting any given laws of physics described by general nonlinear partial differential equations. In this work, we present our developments in the context of solving two main classes of problems: data-driven solution and data-driven discovery of partial differential equations. Depending on the nature and arrangement of the available data, we devise two distinct types of algorithms, namely continuous time and discrete time models. The first type of models forms a new family of data-efficient spatio-temporal function approximators, while the latter type allows the use of arbitrarily accurate implicit Runge–Kutta time stepping schemes with unlimited number of stages. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through a collection of classical problems in fluids, quantum mechanics, reaction–diffusion systems, and the propagation of nonlinear shallow-water waves.}
